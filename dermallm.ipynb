            "\n",
            "**1. Overall Description of the Visible Rash:**\n",
            "You have a noticeably red and inflamed skin rash, primarily located on the left side of your face, covering a significant portion of your left cheek. It appears to be an acute (meaning it likely developed recently or suddenly) and inflammatory rash, suggesting your body is reacting strongly to something.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Key Characteristics Observed:**\n",
            "*   **Bumps and Spots:** The rash is made up of many small, raised red bumps. Mixed in with these are numerous \"pus-filled spots\" (pustules), which are essentially bumps with distinct yellowish-white centers indicating a collection of pus.\n",
            "*   **Redness:** The skin around and under these bumps is quite red, ranging from a moderate pinkish-red to a very bright, intense scarlet-red in the most affected areas.\n",
            "*   **Swelling:** There's significant swelling and puffiness in the affected area of your cheek, making the skin appear raised and thickened, especially where the rash is most dense.\n",
            "*   **Surface:** The bumps and pus-filled spots generally have a smooth, somewhat taut surface. The surrounding skin also appears smooth, with no obvious flaking, peeling, or open sores. The pus is contained within the spots and is not oozing out.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Pattern and Distribution Notes:**\n",
            "*   **Location:** The rash is very prominent on your left cheek, extending towards the eye area, side of the nose, and down across the middle of the cheek.\n",
            "*   **Spread:** It's concentrated heavily in the central part of your left cheek, where the individual spots are very close together and appear to merge into larger patches of intense redness and inflammation. Towards the edges of the rash, the spots become more scattered and distinct.\n",
            "*   **Asymmetry:** This rash is clearly more severe and noticeable on the left side of your face, showing a marked difference compared to the right side.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Visual Features of Interest:**\n",
            "The most striking features are the combination of the bright, vivid red color, the noticeable raised bumps and yellow-centered pus spots, and the visible swelling that changes the contour of your cheek. Despite the inflammation, the skin surface largely remains intact, with no signs of scaling, crusting (dried scabs), or large areas of skin breakdown.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Recommended Next Steps for Professional Evaluation:**\n",
            "Based purely on these visual observations, it is **highly recommended that you see a doctor or dermatologist as soon as possible.** While this analysis describes what is visible, it cannot provide a diagnosis or recommend specific treatment. A healthcare professional will be able to:\n",
            "*   Perform a physical examination.\n",
            "*   Ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms (e.g., pain, itching, fever).\n",
            "*   Potentially run tests (like a skin culture) to determine the exact cause of the rash.\n",
            "*   Provide an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan to help clear up the rash and manage any discomfort.\n",
